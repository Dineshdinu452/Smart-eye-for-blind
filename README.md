Third eye for the blind is an innovation with the help of the multidiscipline subjects like computer science, electronics engineering and health science which helps the blind people to navigate with speed and confidence by detecting the nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and notify them with a buzzer sound or vibration. According to WHO 39 million people are estimated as blinds worldwide. They are suffering a lot of hardships in their daily life. This will be a wearable technology for the blinds.
